# §LIMIT-05 companion — Case 900 annual heating out of band: reproduction, isolation, and a falsified mass-node hypothesis

**Status:** investigation record on develop. The measurement hooks described
in §5/§6 (`FLUXION_MASS_SUBSTEPS`, `FLUXION_CONDITIONED_SUBSTEPS`) live only
on the closed DO-NOT-MERGE branch `physics/limit35-case900-conditioned-subhourly`
(PR #4333); they are **not** in develop's tree. Develop's physics is unchanged
hourly stepping. §7 records the decision taken on this investigation.

**Scope note:** this is the Case 900 (high-mass) annual **heating**
over-prediction. It is pre-existing on develop `7d144c80`, unrelated to the
§LIMIT-33 fix (Case 900 is 9R4C-path ideal-loads-insensitive; variants of the
LIMIT-33 fix leave Case 900 bit-identical), and distinct from the §LIMIT-05
*peak-cooling under-prediction* symptom, though both live in the high-mass
path.

## 1. Reproduction (develop `7d144c80`, default build, Denver-Stapleton TMY EPW)

Harness: `ASHRAE140Validator::simulate_case_with_diagnostics` on
`ASHRAE140Case::Case900` (the production validator path; per
`step_dispatcher.rs` the high-mass spec is promoted selector-independently to
the 9R4C network, so `new_with_selector(NineRFourC)` returns identical
numbers to `new()`).

| Quantity | Value | Reference band |
|---|---|---|
| Annual heating | **3,477.88 kWh** | [1,170, 2,040] kWh → **+70.6% over the upper bound** |
| Annual cooling | 923.56 kWh | [2,130, 3,670] kWh → under |
| Peak heating | 3.304 kW | [1.80, 2.40] kW |

Standalone `ThermalModel` harnesses agree (3,249.6 kWh over 8,760 h with
14-day warmup via `DenverTmyWeather`); the ASHRAE140_RESULTS.md snapshot's
5,052.83 kWh is a stale/legacy build, not current develop.

Temperature trace: zone air never drops below the heating setpoint (min
exactly 20.00 °C, mean 23.32 °C) while heating energy is positive in
**3,722 of 8,760 hours** — the metered heating is the full net load of a
zone held at setpoint, and it is the *magnitude* of that net load that is
wrong.

Monthly split: Jan 934 / Feb 588 / Mar 187 / Apr 7 / Oct 85 / Nov 521 /
Dec 928 kWh — a physically plausible seasonal shape; the excess is spread
over the whole heating season, not a spike artifact.

Hourly split: nearly uniform across the day (63 kWh at 15:00 to 207 kWh at
06:00, annual totals per clock hour) — midday solar offsets only ~50–70% of
the noon-hour load, which for a high-mass single-zone building with large
south glazing is the signature of either under-captured solar gain or
over-counted envelope loss.

## 2. Decisive experiment: whole-step timestep refinement

Running the same annual loop with the physics step divided into N sub-steps
per hour (same hourly weather drivers, `step_physics(dt=3600/N)`):

| N | dt | Annual heating (kWh) | Annual cooling (kWh) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3600 s | 3,249.6 | 1,602.4 |
| 2 | 1800 s | 4,717.9 | 555.5 |
| 4 | 900 s | **1,802.7** | 192.2 |
| 6 | 600 s | **1,305.7** | 126.9 |

At dt = 600 s the heating energy lands **inside the published band
[1,170, 2,040] kWh**, and the sequence converges toward it (the N=2
overshoot is the kind of non-monotone step seen when a stiff node crosses an
integration stability boundary). Refining the *whole* discretized hour
reproduces the reference behavior. This localizes the error to the
**hour-scale discretization of the coupled air-node/HVAC/gain system**, not
to any slow (building-mass-scale) drift.

## 3. Falsification: sub-stepping the mass node alone does NOT converge

§LIMIT-29 hypothesis 3 attributes the high-mass errors to the mass-node
integrator (dt/τ ≈ 0.81 at Case 900's τ ≈ 1.23 h on the 5R1C air
trajectory). Two targeted tests of that hypothesis, both now in the tree as
env-gated hooks:

1. **Lumped 9R4C mass block** (`step_9r4c.rs` mass-temperature backward
   Euler; hook applied temporarily, `FLUXION_MASS_SUBSTEPS=12`): validator
   Case 900 heating unchanged
   to 5 decimals (3,477.88 kWh). That block's output demonstrably does not
   drive the conditioned-air trajectory (consistent with its own comment:
   the multi-node network, not the lumped mass, sets the high-mass air
   temperature).
2. **Multi-node solver sub-step override** (`multi_node_solver/mod.rs`
   `step_with_gains`, same env var; the adaptive path there already
   sub-steps to 12 when dt > 4τ but τ for the 900 envelope exceeds dt/4, so
   it normally runs 1): N = 2/4/6/12 gives 3,484.2 / 3,487.4 / 3,488.5 /
   3,489.6 kWh — a +12 kWh drift **away** from the band.

Conclusion: **the mass-node backward Euler is not the root cause** of the
heating over-prediction. The convergence seen in §2 must come from refining
the air-node balance and the HVAC setpoint-feedback/metering loop at
sub-hour resolution (the same loop §LIMIT-33's state feedback closes at
hour resolution). The τ-based hypotheses in §LIMIT-29 remain valid for the
peak-cooling under-prediction (§LIMIT-05) but are not what pushes annual
heating out of band.

## 4. Proposed fix direction (not implemented — review first)

Refine the **conditioned-hour inner loop**: with the zone held at setpoint,
solve the air-node balance and meter the HVAC energy with sub-hour steps
(or in closed form for the piecewise-constant drivers), leaving the mass
node hour-stepped. Success criterion: Case 900 heating moves monotonically
toward [1,170, 2,040] kWh as the inner refinement increases, with Case 600
(NAPI/WD600 5,590.48 kWh in [4,314, 5,836]) and the recorded-value baselines
re-checked per the re-record discipline — never tuned to pass.

## 5. Measurement hooks in this branch

- `FLUXION_MASS_SUBSTEPS` (multi-node solver): forces N sub-steps in
  `step_with_gains`; unset/0 → adaptive logic bit-identical to develop.
- The same variable name in the 9R4C **lumped** mass block is intentionally
  not kept (zero observable effect; removed to avoid dead knobs).

Both hooks exist to make §3's numbers reproducible by anyone; neither is
wired into any gate.

## 6. Implementation (2026-10-08): conditioned-hour sub-hourly inner loop — measured outcome, DO NOT MERGE

Alex's direction (2026-10-07): implement sub-hourly timesteps for the
conditioned-hour air-node + HVAC-metering inner loop, "maybe 10 or 15
minutes". Implemented in `try_step_physics`
(`src/sim/thermal_model_physics/step_dispatcher.rs`): every hourly
(dt = 3600 s) physics step now runs as an inner loop of N = 4 equal
sub-steps (15-minute; `FLUXION_CONDITIONED_SUBSTEPS` overrides N for
investigation), with loads/solar computed once per hour and per-sub-step
HVAC metering summed to the hour. The `FLUXION_MASS_SUBSTEPS`
multi-node measurement hook from §5 is retained; the zero-effect lumped
9R4C hook was folded away as the doc suggested.

### Decisive finding: the production Case 900 path does not respond to outer-dt refinement

The §2 convergence was measured on the **standalone plain-`ThermalModel`
(5R1C, synthetic Denver) harness**. On the production validator/EPW path —
where the Case 900 HighMass spec is auto-promoted to the **9R4C** network —
refining the outer step is a near no-op:

| Path | N=1 | N=4 (15 min) | N=6 (10 min) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case 900 spec → 9R4C (EPW, 14-day warmup, standalone) | 3,143.8 kWh | 3,147.7 kWh | 3,148.2 kWh |
| Validator Case 900 (default N=4 on this branch) | — | **3.47 MWh — unchanged, still out of band** | — |

The 9R4C air node is quasi-steady and its multi-node mass block already
sub-steps internally (τ-adaptive), so outer-dt refinement cannot move it.
Consistent with §3: the discretization error that puts Case 900 heating out
of band is not reachable through the timestep at all on this path.

### What the loop does move: the 5R1C path — Case 600 regresses

| Quantity (NAPI/WD600 harness) | develop (hourly) | this branch (N=4) | band |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case 600 heating | 5,590.48 kWh | **4,450.67 kWh** (in) | [4,314, 5,836] |
| Case 600 cooling | 4,675.48 kWh | **9,777.69 kWh (out, +109%)** | [4,275, 5,784] |

The golden-EUI hotloop gates (no weather) also move
([1.2518, 1.2522, 1.2526] analytical) — **not re-recorded**, per the
#4314 precedent: baselines are never re-recorded while the physics change
is unreviewed. Verification ladder on this branch: ASHRAE pipeline engine
stage 102 passed / 26 failed; strict ±15% annual-energy gate FAIL (same
reason); npm suite 53/54 (the Case 600 published-band test fails on
cooling); `cargo fmt` clean.

### Status and ask

Per Alex's standing rule this PR is DO-NOT-MERGE. The decision needed:
the sub-hourly conditioned-hour loop as directed (a) does not fix Case 900
(9R4C path is timestep-robust — the LIMIT-05-family roof-solar
under-counting is the live suspect there), and (b) buys Case 600 heating
margin at the cost of blowing Case 600 out of its cooling band. Options
for review: (1) revert this loop and attack Case 900 via the solar
delivery path; (2) keep the loop but scope it to conditioned 5R1C models
only and re-record the affected baselines; (3) drop it. The env var
`FLUXION_CONDITIONED_SUBSTEPS=1` restores hourly behavior exactly.

## 7. Decision (2026-10-08): sub-hourly stepping empirically ruled out for the production path; solar-delivery investigation opened

Alex chose option (3) from issue #4332 on 2026-10-08: drop the
sub-hourly conditioned-hour loop and attack Case 900 heating via the
solar-delivery path (the §LIMIT-05-family roof-solar under-counting
suspect).

Evidence for the rule-out, all measured (PR #4333, closed unmerged; branch
`physics/limit35-case900-conditioned-subhourly` deleted after this doc and
the issue preserved its numbers):

- The production Case 900 path (HighMass → 9R4C, EPW) is outer-dt-invariant:
  3,143.8 kWh (N=1) → 3,148.2 kWh (N=6) standalone; validator unchanged at
  3,477.88 kWh under N=4. The §2 convergence lives only on the standalone
  plain-5R1C harness and does not transfer to the 9R4C validator path.
- The loop does move the 5R1C path, and adversely: Case 600 NAPI/WD600
  cooling 4,675.48 → 9,777.69 kWh — +109% over the [4,275, 5,784] band —
  while heating moved 5,590.48 → 4,450.67 kWh (in band). A change that
  regresses cooling by +109% cannot be scoped around without baseline
  re-records under unreviewed physics.

Consequence: develop keeps hourly stepping exactly. No
`FLUXION_CONDITIONED_SUBSTEPS` code, env hook, or baseline re-record lands.

Next step: quantify roof solar delivery for Case 900 (incidence, absorbed
fraction, shading path on the 900 geometry vs 600) against the ASHRAE 140
reference assumptions, and measure what solar-delivery delta would bring
heating into [1,170, 2,040] kWh. Recorded in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
§LIMIT-35.

## 8. Solar-delivery investigation (2026-10-08): roof-solar under-counting falsified; horizontal ground-reflection over-count found instead

Alex's option (3): attack Case 900 heating via the solar-delivery path.
Method: reproduce the recorded numbers first (validator Case 900
3,477.88 / 923.56 kWh H/C; Case 600 harness 5,590.48 / 4,675.48 kWh —
both exact), then isolate with split experiments (temporary in-place
edits, reverted after each measurement; never committed).

### Measurements

**Irradiance source.** With the engine's own solar-position and
`calculate_surface_irradiance` formulas over the Denver-Stapleton TMY
EPW, the horizontal (roof) plane receives **2,180.4 kWh/m²·yr** while the
EPW's own GHI is **1,831.9 kWh/m²·yr** — a **+19% over-count** (348
kWh/m²·yr ≈ ρ·GHI, ρ = 0.2). Cause: Issue #1326 pinned the isotropic
ground-reflected view factor at β = 0° to the FULL ρ·GHI, on the premise
that "a horizontal roof sees the full ground hemisphere". That premise is
physically backwards — an up-facing horizontal plane's normal points at
the zenith, so the ground hemisphere is entirely behind the plane and the
view factor (1 − cos β)/2 correctly gives **0** there. The repo's own
EnergyPlus 25.2 reference data confirms:
`tests/reference_data/solar/case_900_roof_solar_hourly.csv` (Case 900
roof, tilt = 0) records `ground_diffuse_irradiance = 0.0` for all 8,760
hours. Oct–Apr roof-plane: 952.3 vs GHI 802.0 kWh/m² (+18.7%).

**Geometry / shading / absorptance (900 vs 600).** Identical: 48 m² roof
(U ≈ 0.317), 12 m² south glazing, no overhangs or fins on either case,
α_roof = 0.7 / α_wall = 0.6, same site (lat 39.83, lon −104.65). The
cases differ only in mass and in `solar_distribution_to_air` (900 → 0.0,
600 → 0.3). No Case-900-specific solar under-delivery exists in geometry
or shading.

**Delivery routes and split experiments** (validator path, Denver EPW;
ΔH/ΔC in kWh/yr):

| Route | Experiment | ΔH | ΔC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Roof sol-air BC (`t_ext_roof`, step_9r4c) | drop ground term from roof irradiance | +110.4 | −122.5 |
| Roof sol-air BC | double roof irradiance | −572.6 | +913.8 |
| Conducted opaque gain → mass node (`phi_m`) | double the injection | **bit-identical** | **bit-identical** |

The `phi_m` opaque route has zero observable effect on Case 900 annual
H/C — the internal mass node it feeds does not drive the conditioned-air
trajectory (consistent with §3). The only effective roof-solar lever is
the sol-air boundary condition, at ≈ 0.26–0.32 kWh of heating per
kWh/m²·yr of roof-plane irradiance.

### Verdict

**The roof-solar under-counting hypothesis (§LIMIT-05 suspect) is
falsified.** Roof solar is if anything OVER-counted (+19% at the
irradiance source), and correcting the over-count moves Case 900 heating
*up* (3,477.88 → 3,588.28 under the full fix, i.e. further out of
band). Quantitatively, reaching the band [1,170, 2,040] kWh through roof
solar alone would require ΔH = −1,438 kWh (upper bound) to −1,873 kWh
(midpoint), i.e. +4,600–7,100 kWh/m²·yr of roof-plane irradiance on top
of the current 2,180 — 3–4.5× the physically correct value — while
cooling would swing +1,900 to +2,900 kWh toward its own band. No
physical roof-solar correction can close the heating gap.

The ground-reflection finding is still a genuine physics bug (E+-backed),
prepared as DO-NOT-MERGE PR: fix `fix/horizontal-ground-reflection` —
view factor used continuously at the endpoints (β=0° → 0, β=180° → ρ·GHI),
premise test `test_horizontal_ground_reflected` updated with the
corrected physics. **Do not merge and do not re-record baselines before
Alex's physics review** (#4314 precedent). Measured outcome of the fix:
validator Case 900 H 3,477.88 → 3,588.28, C 923.56 → 801.09; validator
Case 600 (Denver path) H 6,165.34 → 6,238.59, C 4,666.73 → 4,498.34;
engine roof-plane irradiance 2,180.4 → 1,814.2 kWh/m²·yr (ratio to GHI
0.990).

Next suspect for Case 900 heating: the air-node/HVAC setpoint-feedback
loop at hour resolution on the 9R4C path (§4's original direction), and
the winter storage-release coupling of the mass network — both outside
the solar-delivery path.
