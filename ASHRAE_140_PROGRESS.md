## Validation Metrics

### Current Performance (Latest Run)

```
Test Results: ✓ 2 passed
├─ test_all_cases_instantiation: All 18 cases instantiate correctly
└─ test_ashrae_140_comprehensive_validation: Full validation suite

Validation Summary:
├─ Total Results: 36 metrics (2 per case: annual heating + cooling)
├─ Pass Rate: 27.8% (10 passed)
├─ Warning Rate: 0% (0 warnings)
├─ Failure Rate: 72.2% (26 failed)
└─ Mean Absolute Error: 339.12%

Case Performance:
├─ Controlled Cases: ~6 fail (annual energy too high)
├─ Free-Floating Cases: 8/8 pass (correctly showing 0.0 energy)
└─ Variance: High deviation suggests physics tuning needed
```

### Known Issues

1. **Annual Energy Variance**: Controlled cases show 2-6x higher heating/cooling than reference
   - Root Cause: Likely HVAC scheduling or setpoint logic
   - Impact: Most annual energy metrics fail
   - Status: Under investigation

2. **Peak Load Values**: Very small (1.39-2.78 kW)
   - Root Cause: HVAC capacity or timestep duration?
   - Impact: Peak metrics not in reference range
   - Status: Needs investigation (newly tracked)

3. **Multi-Zone Cooling**: Case 960 shows 36.25 MWh vs 1.55-2.78 MWh reference
   - Root Cause: Zone coupling or inter-zone heat transfer
   - Impact: Multi-zone case validation failing
   - Status: Requires investigation after baseline stabilizes
